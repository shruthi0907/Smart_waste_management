# Smart-Waste-Management-System
============================================================

One of the most significant issues created by the expanding urbanization is garbage management. Several steps make to an effective method for dealing with the waste management problem. To begin, we must consume things in a sensible manner in order to eliminate unnecessary waste. Following that, garbage disposal should be done in a systematic manner. Finally, garbage should be recycled to the greatest extent possible. Economic and environmental considerations should be taken into account when implementing these steps. 

Waste disposal has a large impact on both factors, and optimizing it can increase the positive effects greatly. Simultaneously, there is a clear requirement that recycling bins be emptied on a regular basis to ensure them clean. Meeting this condition is tough in a situation with thousands of recycling stations (each one with numerous containers) distributed across a large geographic area. 


The primary purpose of this project is to investigate and test a method for determining when a container has been emptied.

The existing manually constructed model and its modification, as well as traditional machine learning algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks, K-nearest neighbors, Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest, are among the methodologies explored. The existing manually constructed model's classification accuracy and recall were improved from 86.8% and 47.9% to 99.1% and 98.2% thanks to the introduction of machine learning algorithms. The Random Forest classifier, which was the highest performing option, enhanced the quality of forecasts for recycling container emptying times. The highest performing solution increased accuracy by 12.3% and recall by 50.3 percent, while also increasing the FI score by 0.347 and the MCC score by 0.366 percent
